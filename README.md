# Usage

This template mile is a modified version of Event Tickets Plus' `views/wootickets/tickets.php` template. It's made to be dropped into the Basel theme, where it will improve compatibility with the theme's implementation of WooCommerce's AJAX "Add to Cart" functionality.


To this file, do the following steps:

1. Create a `tribe-events` folder in your copy of the Basel theme
2. Create a `wootickets` folder within this `tribe-events` folder
3. Clone this repo's `tickets.php` file into that folder.
4. Not sure what "cloning this repo" means? **No sweat!** Simply create a file in that `wootickets` folder called `tickets.php`
5. Copy the entire, unedited code from this repo's `tickets.php` file
6. Paste the entire code into that `tickets.php` file you created in steap #4

You should now have a file at this path:
`wp-content/themes/basel/tribe-events/wootickets/tickets.php`

And the contents of that file should exactly match the contents of the `tickets.php` file found in this repo.
